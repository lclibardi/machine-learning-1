## @session_model_generate.py
#  This file receives data (i.e. settings) required to query from the database,
#      a previously stored session, involving one or more stored dataset uploads,
#      and generates an SVM model, respectively. The new SVM model, is stored
#      into respective database table(s), which later can be retrieved within
#      'session_model_use.py'.
#
#  Note: the term 'dataset' used throughout various comments in this file,
#        synonymously implies the user supplied 'file upload(s)', and XML url
#        references.
